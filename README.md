# Babylon Web technical recruitment test

Thanks for taking the time to complete our frontend coding test! You can start with forking this repository and off you go.

Good luck!

## Mandatory Requirements ⚠️

- You must provide notes on your implementation using the [template provided here](./notes.md).

## What we are looking for

We'd like you to build an application that:

- has a sensible and maintainable structure
- is well tested
- is accessible
- looks like the designs provided (it doesn't have to be "pixel perfect")
- mobile first and responsive
- clean and understandable Git history

# Instructions

We'd like you to use React. We have provided a skeleton for the React application and included [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for styling. We have also provided some useful constants in [constants.scss](./src/constants.scss). Feel free to add any additional libraries which you think are needed for the task.

We included some initial code in App.js that we would like you to refactor.

We have also included a mock API which is documented below.

We'd like you to build one page. We've provided the design. On this page the user can:

- Filter appointments by their type (GP, therapist, specialist)
- Select date and time
- Select appointment type (audio, video)
- Book an appointment

# New appointment page

- `notes`: `String` Any notes the user added when booking. _note_: not required, can be null.
